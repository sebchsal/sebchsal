- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sebchsal im a developer and I am a guy with a great passion in learning technology and in this case software development,
I like to keep myself trained with new knowledge and demonstrating my skills in every job I do, always leaving a grain of sand, being
this grain a great contribution to what has been achieved.

- I continue on my path, a path that has left, is leaving and will leave successes in time.
