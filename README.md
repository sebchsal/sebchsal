-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @sebchsal, someone with a great passion in learning technology, focused on software development, cybersecurity and more, I like to keep myself trained with new knowledge and demonstrating my skills in every job I do, always leaving a grain of sand, being this grain of sand a great contribution to any goal.

-I continue on my path, a path that has left, is leaving and will leave successes in time.
